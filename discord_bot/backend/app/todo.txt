Non-Breaking Changes:
- Update add to have the new average 
- Update STO to be properly calculated as a sell not a buy


Breaking Changes:

- Change Size to "Level" (1-6) (mabye only change in the display)
- Add /buy and /sell to the bot
    - These are to work with common stock
- Add /fut (future) command to the bot [Need to discuss with Justin]
- Format Option commands to be in order of the one liner DATE, SYMBOL, STRIKE, CALL/PUT, COST, LEVEL
- Change all ephemeral responses to be going to a logging channel with what the command was instead of the message back to the user.

Continuous Integration:
- Add a .github/workflows/ folder with a workflow for running the bot
